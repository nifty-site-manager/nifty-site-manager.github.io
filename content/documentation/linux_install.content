<h2>Installing nifty-site-manager on linux from source</h2>

<h3>Installing a <mono>c++</mono> compiler</h3>

<p>
	If you do not already have a <mono>c++</mono> compiler then you will need to install one.
</p>

<p>
	Use your package manager to install <mono>build-essential</mono>. For example on Ubuntu, run <mono>sudo apt-get install build-essential</mono> from a terminal window. 
</p>

<h3>Installing <mono>nsm</mono></h3>

Download <a href="https://gitlab.com/nifty-site-manager/nsm/repository/master/archive.zip">nsm-master-*.zip</a>, then follow these steps to compile and install:

<ol>
	<li>
		Extract <mono>nsm-master-*</mono> from <mono>nsm-master-*.zip</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Open a terminal window and change directory to <mono>nsm-master-*</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Compile <mono>nsm</mono> by running <mono>make</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Install <mono>nsm</mono> by running <mono>sudo make linux-install</mono> (note - you will need to enter your password) (note - you may need to open a new terminal window for nsm installation to be recognised);
	</li>
	<li>
		Delete both the file <mono>nsm-master-*.zip</mono> and the directory <mono>nsm-master-*</mono> containing the uncompiled code. 
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	For example, if you unzipped <mono>nsm-master-*</mono> inside your downloads folder, then steps 1-4 are achieved by entering the following into your terminal window:

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="prettyprint inline rounded lang-bsh">
			cd ~/Downloads/nsm-master-*
			make
			sudo make linux-install
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>

<p>
	You can use <mono>make linux-gedit-highlighting</mono> on top of <mono>make install</mono> during step 3 to get <mono>gedit</mono> (do you gedit yet?) to automatically use html syntax highlighting for both <mono>*.content</mono> and <mono>*.template</mono> files.
</p>

<h3>Uninstalling <mono>nsm</mono></h3>
<p>
	Should you ever want to remove <mono>nsm</mono> from your machine (aka commit blasphemy), simply run <mono>sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/nsm</mono> from any terminal window.
</p>
