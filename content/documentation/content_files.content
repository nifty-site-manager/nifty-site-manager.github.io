<h4>
	Escaping characters
</h4>
<p>
	Nsm will escape the following characters: \~, \!, \@, \#, \%, \^, \*, \?, \<, \>. Just put <mono>\character-to-escape</mono>, for example to escape tilde use <mono>\\~</mono>.
</p>

<p>
	<u>Note:</u> nsm does not, and will not, escape \$ (nor does it escape &). This is because it conflicts with MathJax escaping \$. If you do not want to use MathJax on your site and want \$ escaped then manually uncomment the relevant code in <mono>PageBuilder.cpp</mono> before compiling and installing nsm.
</p>

<h4>
	Inserting date, time and timezone information
</h4>
<p>
	The date and time that a page was built may be inserted using <mono>\@currentdate</mono> and <mono>\@currenttime</mono>. The timezone this date and time information is associated with may also be inserted using <mono>\@timezone</mono>.
</p>

<h4>
	Inserting text from other files
</h4>
<p>
	Text may be inserted from another file using <mono>\@input(path-to-file)</mono>, where <mono>path-to-file</mono> is the path from the main site directory to the input file.
</p>

<p>
	For example suppose inside your website directory you have <mono>template/footer.content</mono>:

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="inline rounded">
			Page was last built on \@currentdate.
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>

<p>
	To insert <mono>template/footer.content</mono> into another file write:

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="inline rounded">
			\@input(template/footer.content)
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>

<p>
	<u>Note:</u> nsm will not let you create an input loop, for example you cannot have <mono>\@input(page.template)</mono> inside <mono>page.template</mono>, or any of the files that <mono>page.template</mono> inputs, or any of the files that they input, and so on. 
</p>

<h4>
	Paths from pages to other pages/files
</h4>

<p>
	It is possible for pages $A$ and $B$ to be located in distinct directories yet input text from the same content file $X$. Consequently if content file $X$ contains a path to another page $Y$, you have the problem that the path from $A$ to $Y$ is not the same as the path from $B$ to $Y$. You can solve this non-constant path problem by using <mono>\@pathto(path-to-page)</mono> or <mono>\@pathtopage(path-to-page)</mono> where <mono>path-to-page</mono> is the path from the main site directory to page $Y$. When building a page, nsm will replace <mono>\@pathto(path-to-file)</mono> with the path from the page being built to file $Y$.
</p>

<p>
	An example of when users may find this useful is when writing menus for page templates, or adding local links for any template files.
</p>

<p>
	When using <mono>\@pathto(path-to-page)</mono> or <mono>\@pathtopage(path-to-page)</mono>, nsm will throw an error if the page is not being tracked by nsm. You can solve the non-constant path problem for arbitrary files by using <mono>\@pathtofile(path-to-file)</mono> where <mono>path-to-file</mono> is the path from the main site directory to file $Y$ (where page $Y$ above has been replaced with file $Y$). When building a page, nsm will throw an error if the file does not exit.
</p>

<h4>
	Including css files
</h4>
<p>
	You can include a css file using <mono>\@cssinclude(path-to-css-file)</mono>, where <mono>path-to-css-file</mono> is the path from the main site directory to the css file (<u>not</u> the path from the page to the css file). When building a page, nsm will replace <mono>\@cssinclude(path-to-css-file)</mono> with:

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-js inline rounded">
			<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='path-from-page-to-css-file'>
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>

<h4>
	Including js files
</h4>
<p>
	You can include a js file using <mono>\@jsinclude(path-to-js-file)</mono>, where <mono>path-to-js-file</mono> is the path from the main site directory to the js file (<u>not</u> the path from the page to the js file). When building a page, nsm will replace <mono>\@jsinclude(path-to-js-file)</mono> with: 

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-js inline rounded">
			<script src="path-from-page-to-js-file"></script>
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>

<h4>
	Including a favicon file
</h4>
<p>
	You can include a favicon file using <mono>\@faviconinclude(path-to-favicon-file)</mono>, where <mono>path-to-favicon-file</mono> is the path from the main site directory to the favicon file (<u>not</u> the path from the page to the favicon file). When building a page, nsm will replace <mono>\@faviconinclude(path-to-favicon-file)</mono> with:

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-js inline rounded">
			<link rel='icon' type='image/png' href='path-from-page-to-favicon-file'>
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>
