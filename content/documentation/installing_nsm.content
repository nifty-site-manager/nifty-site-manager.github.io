<h3>
	Installing a c++ compiler
</h3>

If you do not already have a c++ compiler then you will need to install one.

<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>Linux</h4>
		Use your package manager to install <mono>build-essential</mono>. For example on Ubuntu, run <mono>sudo apt-get install build-essential</mono> from a terminal window. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
		<p>
			Install <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a>. Should you still encounter any problems compiling nsm there is a good chance <mono>command line tools</mono> was not installed by default. To manually install it yourself: open Xcode, go to <mono>preferences</mono>, click on the <mono>downloads</mono> tab, then you should be able to download and install <mono>command line tools</mono>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<u>Note:</u> I would also be curious to know how easy it is for osx users to access hidden files from finder? On Ubuntu for example I can just use <mono>ctrl/cmd h</mono> to toggle between showing/hiding hidden files/directories. 
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>
	Installing nsm
</h3>

Download <a href="https://github.com/nifty-site-manager/nsm/archive/master.zip">nsm-master.zip</a>, then follow these steps to compile and install:

<ol>
	<li>
		Extract <mono>nsm-master</mono> from <mono>nsm-master.zip</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Open a terminal window and change directory to <mono>nsm-master</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Compile nsm by running <mono>make</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Install nsm by running <mono>make install</mono> (note - you will need to enter your password);
	</li>
	<li>
		Delete both the file <mono>nsm-master.zip</mono> and the directory <mono>nsm-master</mono> containing the uncompiled code. 
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	For example, if you unzipped <mono>nsm-master</mono> inside your downloads folder, then steps 1-4 are achieved by entering the following into your terminal window:

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="inline rounded">
			cd ~/Downloads/nsm-master
			make
			make install
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>

<h3>
	Uninstalling nsm
</h3>
<p>
	Should you ever want to remove nsm from your machine, simply run <mono>sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/nsm</mono> from any terminal window.
