<h2>Installing <mono>Nift</mono> on osx from source</h2>
<h3>Installing a <mono>c++</mono> compiler</h3>

<p>
	Install <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a>. Should you still encounter any problems compiling <mono>nsm</mono> there is a good chance <mono>command line tools</mono> was not installed by default. To manually install it yourself: open Xcode, go to <mono>preferences</mono>, click on the <mono>downloads</mono> tab, then you should be able to download and install <mono>command line tools</mono>.
</p>

<h3>Installing <mono>Nift</mono></h3>

<p>
	Download <a href="https://gitlab.com/nifty-site-manager/nsm/repository/master/archive.zip">nsm-master-*.zip</a>, then follow these steps to compile and install:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Extract <mono>nsm-master-*</mono> from <mono>nsm-master-*.zip</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Open a terminal window and change directory to <mono>~/Downloads/nsm-master-*</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Compile <mono>nsm</mono> by running <mono>make</mono>;
	</li>
	<li>
		Install <mono>nsm</mono> by running <mono>sudo make osx-install</mono> (note - you will need to enter your password) (note - you may need to open a new terminal window for nsm installation to be recognised);
	</li>
	<li>
		Delete both the file <mono>nsm-master-*.zip</mono> and the directory <mono>nsm-master-*</mono> containing the uncompiled code. 
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	For example, if you unzipped <mono>nsm-master-*</mono> inside your downloads folder, then steps 1-4 are achieved by entering the following into your terminal window:

	<div align="center">
		<pre class="prettyprint inline rounded lang-bsh">
			cd ~/Downloads/nsm-master-*
			make
			sudo make osx-install
		</pre>
	</div>
</p>

	Should you ever want to remove <mono>nsm</mono> from your machine, simply run <mono>sudo make osx-uninstall</mono>.
