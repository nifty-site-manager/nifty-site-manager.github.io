					There are a number of different projects you can undertake which will help you get a better idea of how <mono>Nift</mono> works. For example you could make:
					<ul style="text-indent:30px">
						<li>an example website to be listed on the <a href="@pathto(resources/examples)">examples</a> page; or</li>
						<li>a site repository template to be listed on the <a href="@pathto(resources/templates)">templates</a> page.</li>
					</ul>

						<li>Set up a fan site, it could be based on something you are a fan of, a team you are a fan of, a sport/hobby/lifestyle you are a fan of etc.;</li>
						<li>Set up an education based website on something you are knowledgeable/interested on/in or would like to become knowledgeable on;
						<li>Set up a team/hobby/interest site;</li>

						<li>Figure out all the different ways you can think of to test <mono>Nift</mono>, including writing programs to test <mono>Nift</mono> if that is within your skillset, all feedback here is welcome at <mono>testing@nifty-site-manager.com</mono>, especially if you can find a way to 'break' <mono>Nift</mono>;
						<li>Learn and play with other site managers so you have a better understanding of site managers in general, and have some idea about the differences between the different site managers, maybe a different site manager will work better for you and/or your needs?;</li>
