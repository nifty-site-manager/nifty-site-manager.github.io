	It would be awesome to have a list of websites or BitBucket/GitHub/GitLab groups/respositories people have set up with templates for all sorts of different things including different kinds of websites. Please contact <mono>contact@nifty-site-manager.com</mono> if this is something you or a group of people would like to work on.

	Some people/groups might like to become <mono>template makers</mono>, or <mono>templaters</mono> for short, and help build communities for all the different site managers out there, and help make the site managers accessible to people from all different walks of life for all sorts of different purposes.
