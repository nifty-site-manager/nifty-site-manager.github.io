				<p>
					Note if you have any dyanmic pages (eg. are using php) then you will need to use an alternative for hosting.
				</p>

				<p>
					Information on Netlify may be found <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/">here</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					To host a website on Netlify you will first need to upload your website to a respository on BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab. 
				</p>

				<p>
					By far the easiest way to host a website on BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab is to import or fork an existing site repository from BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab or any other code sharing platform. See <a href="@pathto(resources/templates)">here</a> for a variety of templates you can use to make websites.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once you have a website on BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab you can host it on Netlify by following these steps:
					<ol>
						<li>Singup for Netlify using either BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab or email;</li>
						<li>Login to Netlify using either BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab or email;</li>
						<li>Click on <mono>New site from Git</mono>;</li>
						<li>Choose which Git provider you want to use (BitBucket, GitHub or Gitlab);</li>
						<li>Select the repository containing your website;</li>
						<li>Select the branch containing the website (typically master), leave the build command blank and enter the directory containing the website (typically left blank for BitBucket and GitHub, and <mono>site</mono> for GitLab);</li>
						<li>Click deploy site.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>
					If you go in to <mono>domain settings</mono> you can add a custom domain, Netlify will sort out auto renewing Let's encrypt certificates for you which is really handy!
