					Nift has support for you to optinally add in pre/post build/serve scripts to your websites, you can add in however many scripts you want. Just a few of the things this can be useful for include integrating with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, <a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server">Live Server</a>, <a href="http://livereload.com/">Live Reload</a>, etc.. You can call other scripts and programs from inside your scripts, using any scripting language you want, eg. batch, bash shell, fish, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Zsh shell and many more.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Note:</b> Make sure your scripts have executable permissions, otherwise Nift will be unable to run them and should throw a build error. You do not seem to be able to do everything you would want if installing through Flatpak or Snap, I am trying to work out how to fix this otherwise may stop supporting Flatpak and/or Snap.

					On Unix (Linux/OSX) website-wide scripts should reside in the project root directory and be named as follows:
					<div align="center">
						<pre class="inline">
							pre-build.sh
							post-build.sh
							pre-serve.sh
							post-serve.sh
						</pre>
					</div>
				</p>

					On Windows website-wide scripts should reside in the project root directory and be named as follows:
					<div align="center">
						<pre class="inline">
							pre-build.bat
							post-build.bat
							pre-serve.bat
							post-serve.bat
						</pre>
					</div>
				</p>

				<p>
					On Unix (Linux/OSX) page specific scripts should reside in the same directory as the content file for the page. For example if you have a page <mono>dir/pagename</mono>, then your scripts would reside in <mono>dir</mono> where <mono>pagename.content</mono> resides and be named as follows:
					<div align="center">
						<pre class="inline">
							pagename.pre-build.sh
							pagename.post-build.sh
							pagename.pre-serve.sh
							pagename.post-serve.sh
						</pre>
					</div>
