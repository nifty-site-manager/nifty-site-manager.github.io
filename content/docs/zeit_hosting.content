					Hosting on ZEIT
				</h4>
				<p>
					Note if you have any dyanmic pages (eg. are using php) then you will need to use an alternative for hosting.
				</p>

				<p>
					Information on ZEIT may be found <a href="https://zeit.co/docs">here</a>. The <a href="https://zeit.co/pricing">pricing</a> for ZEIT is quite generous:
					<ul>
						<li>Hobby use is free forever</li>
						<li>Pro accounts are $20/month per team member</li>
						<li><a href="https://zeit.co/contact/sales">Enterprise</a> accounts can be made suited to your needs</li>
				</p>

				<p>
					We find the best way to host a website on ZEIT is to upload/push your website to a respository on BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab, then whenever you push website changes to the repository they are automatically deployed by ZEIT. 
				</p>

				<p>
					By far the easiest way to host a website on BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab is to import or fork an existing site repository from BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab or any other code sharing platform. See <a href="@pathto(resources/templates)">here</a> for a variety of templates you can use to make websites.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once you have a website on BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab you can host it on ZEIT by following these steps:
					<ol>
						<li>Singup for ZEIT and login using either BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab;</li>
						<li>Click on <a href="https://zeit.co/import">Import Project</a>;</li>
						<li>Choose <mono>From Git Repository</mono> and select the tab for the provider you want to use;</li>
						<li>Follow the instructions about linking ZEIT with BitBucket, GitHub and/or GitLab;</li>
						<li>Select the repository containing your website;</li>
						<li>Pick a name for your project (using the same name as the repository is a good choice);</li>
						<li>Enter the directory containing the website (typically <mono>./</mono> if you forked/imported a template from BitBucket or GitHub and <mono>site/</mono> if you forked/imported a template from GitLab);</li>
						<li>Leave the build and development commands blank (note, you are then expected to build your website before pushing changes through <mono>git</mono>, though you can put the Ubuntu Nift binary from GitHub releases in your repository and build on ZEIT's servers with that) and enter the directory containing the website (again typically <mono>./</mono> if you forked/imported a template from BitBucket or GitHub and <mono>site/</mono> if you forked/imported a template from GitLab);</li>
						<li>Click deploy site.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>
					If you go in to <mono>View Domains</mono> you can add a custom domain, ZEIT will sort out auto renewing Let's encrypt certificates for you which is really handy!
